**Carfliction**: _adjective_ \
A medical condition where an automotive enthusiast reaches a point of impasse.  

### Where it all started
Carfliction spawned out a work slack channel dedicated to the car projects and
the people that work on them. We were just happy sharing our ideas with with our
co-workers and fellow automotive addicts grew the conversations we had there in
to what you see today. Welcome to the conversations, the jokes, and the
craziness that is Carfliction.

A software developer with enough knowledge to be dangerous I was bitten by the
automotive bug early and driving has always been a part of my life. My current
project is a 1994 Nissan 300zx Twin Turbo which brings be no shortage of joys
and chores.
